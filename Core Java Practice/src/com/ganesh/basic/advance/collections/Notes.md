# Collection
- Object that represents group of objects.
- In general, the group of objects has some relationship with each other.
- e.g. arrays, list, vectors, sets, queues, tables, dictionaries, maps.
- These are differentiated by the way they store the objects in memory, how objects are retrieved and ordered, and whether nulls and duplicate entries are permitted.

## Set operations
- Symmetric
  - A U B = B U A
  - A ^ B = B ^ A
