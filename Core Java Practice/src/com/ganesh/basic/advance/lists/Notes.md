- Lists provide resizable ways to handle sequences of elements, unlike arrays.
- A list is a special type in Java called an Interface, which describes a set of method signatures.
- Various classes in Java implement the List interface, such as AbstractList, ArrayList, AbstractSequentialList, AttributeList, CopyOnWriteArrayList, RoleList, RoleUnresolvedList, Stack, Vector.
- The ArrayList class is a commonly used resizable-array implementation of the List interface.
- ArrayList maintains an array in memory and automatically resizes as elements are added.

- Iterator has the same functionality as database cursor.
- Iterator is forwards only, and only supports the remove method.
- ListIterator ca be used to go both forwards and backwards, and in addition to the remove method, it also supports the add and set methods.
