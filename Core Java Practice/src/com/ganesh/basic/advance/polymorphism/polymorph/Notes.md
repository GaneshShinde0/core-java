## Run Time vs Compile Time Typing
- Why are runtime types different from compile time types?
- Because of polymorphism.
- Polymorphism lets us write code once, in more generic fashion.

## Testing the runtime type using the instance of operator.
- Evaluating what the runtime type is
  - And how do we test what runtime type, of a variable really is at runtime, if the declared type is something else?
  - We can test to see what type the actual object is, at runtime, in several ways.
